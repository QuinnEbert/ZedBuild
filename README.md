ZedBuild
========

My final tinkering project from my two day Thanksgiving hiatus of 2012.

What is it?
===========

To be brutal, it ain't much, merely my first "real" experiment with OpenGL on iOS.  Don't
expect this to do anything useful for you for now; I was just tinkering with the Xcode
sample code through "brute-force" tinkering.  If you've ever played around with the
"OpenGL Game" project template on Xcode, you'll sorta-kinda recognize this, except that I
have managed to modify a few subtle things about the default presentation.

What's next?
============

If you look at my project file, you'll probably see a gesture recognizer.  That's kind of
where I got "bored" with this and shelved it for a while.  If there's a "next step" for
this, setting that up to allow some sort of viewpoint modification is probably where I'm
going next with this.

What's the license?
